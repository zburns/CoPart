Compact Cars for Racing from CoPart

This program is a quick and dirty program to connect to my CoPart.com account, download the cars for sale and look for ones that fit my criteria.

Currently I'm only looking for a vehicle that will Run and Drive, has a wheelbase of less than 107 inches, and I can acquire for less than 500 dollars and has minimal cosmetic damage.

You'll want to change at minimum the SalesDataFile part of the App.config.

I have this system run automatically every few hours, and I add vehicles to the Ignore file I would never purchase (too much structural damage, flood, etc) and the ones I'm Watching go to that file.

Anything else that shows up in the Results file, I need to investigate for determining if it's worth purchasing.

The end result is a compact car that can be used at most local race tracks for fun or the 24 hours of Lemons races.
